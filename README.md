### Submitted By: T. J. PRAKRUTHI
### Programming Language Used: Python
### IDE : Jupyter Notebook

This repository is the tasks given by LetsGrowMore Company for the Virtual Internship Program. For TASK 1 I have made the working model using flask API in PYCHARM for task-1 and remaining I will deploy them one by one.

# BEGINNER LEVEL TASK
## Iris Flowers Classification ML Project
This particular ML project is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
